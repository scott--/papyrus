  change.

2006-03-19 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Drawable: Major cleanup and changes. Added skewing transforms. Added property
  change signal callback to automatically emit on_changed() signal, eliminating
  the need for an explicit call in Drawable or children. Added changed signals
  of properties to public interface. Renamed affine transformation properties
  to reflect their role as affine transforms.

  Enhanced LineCapComboBox with reference points for line ends.

  Renamed CanvasArea to Viewport to fit closer with terminology used by SVG.

  Removed TextBox which is no longer needed with ViewBoxes present

  Added concept of ViewBoxes similar to SVG's viewBox attribute

  Papyrus::Face: Smiley faces, et. al. for test purposes; kinda like OpenGL's
  teapots...

2006-03-18 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Renamed all bbox methods and members to the longer but more appropriate name
  bounding_box.

  Changed BBox to Box to more accurately reflect its upcoming use as more than
  just a bounding box.

  Modified example_line_cap() to generate a Papyrus::Group that not only
  illustrates the line caps, but also illustrates internal reference points.

2006-03-17 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ===== 0.1.8 =====

  cap possibilities.

  Added PapyrusGtk::LineJoinComboBox; a combobox that displays all cairo line
  join possibilities.

  PapyrusGtk: added utility.h to contain utility functions. The first is
  create_pixbuf() which takes a Papyrus::Renderable, width and height
  parameters and returns a Gdk::Pixbuf of the drawing.

2006-03-12 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Text: Fixed rendering bug that needed to calculate extents before scaling.

2006-03-12 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>

2006-03-05 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ========== Release 0.1.6 ==========

  Drawable: Added methods to lock width and/or height to a fixed, constant
  value. Eventually, this probably needs to be moved out of the class and into
  a more general constraint handling mechanism that watches the object's
  signals for changes, but for now this will do.

2006-03-04 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Long overdue cleanup of configure.in et. al.

  Docs now install into $prefix/share/doc/{package}-{version}.

  Separate doc rpm consolidated into devel rpm.


2006-03-03 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Initial port of the Sketchpad from glcanvasmm.

2006-02-28 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Drawable, Shape, Canvas: Documentation updates

2006-02-28 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ========== Release 0.1.5 ==========

  GroupTreeModel: Changed to reflect change in CanvasArea.canvas() that now
  returns a smart pointer to a Canvas object instead of a reference.

  CanvasArea: Major changes here. More functional as a canvas area widget with
  methods like scroll_to(x,y), ability to change scrolling point, etc.

  Shape: Added virtual draw_outline() method that defaults to calling
  draw_shape().

  Drawable: Added is_pickable() method.

  Canvas: Added methods for smart pointer creation and typedef.

  Arc: reimplement the draw_outline() method from parent Shape

2006-02-26 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ========== Release 0.1.4 ==========

  drawable_test: Added scrolling window to introspectable properties.

2006-02-23 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Handlebox: New class derives from Boxed, but also allows placement of
  specifiable shapes in the traditional placements for user interface handles.

  BBox: Added get_center() method

2006-02-22 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Boxed: Fixed update_bounds() method to place contained Drawables entirely in
  bounds. Also updated to recalculate own bounding box based on outline width
  of bounding rectangle.

  Shape: added get_fill() and get_outline() methods. Also implemented
  Shape::set_bbox() which takes into account the outline width in calculating
  the bounding box.

  Drawable: moved m_bbox to a private method to enforce access through
  protected set_bbox() virtual method, which is reimplemented by children such
  as Shape to add outline width in bbox calculations.

  BBox: Added more proper const method notation.


2006-02-21 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ========== Release 0.1.3 ==========

  drawable_test: cleaned up and added controls to test affine transformations

  Boxed: Cleaned up and now works properly. Included example code as well.

  Arc: cleaned and fixed calculation of bounding box on changes

  Drawable: added the concept of a centroid, about which rotation occurs. The
  centroid is defined as an offset from the (x,y) translation point, and is
  used to control, for example, the rotation of a rectangle about it's center
  rather than rotating about the upper left corner. More specific accessors
  will follow to allow the centroid to be more explicitly set.

  Removed the dependency on the boost libraries by replacing the use of the
  boost shared pointer with the shared pointer present in tr1.

2006-02-20 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Arc: fixed bug in drawing when a translation occurs. Completion code
  shouldn't have to take into account x and y values, since underlying draw is
  relative to 0,0 and then the transform matrix is applied.

2006-02-19 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Group: Implemented a proxy/virtual pair for on_child_changed() to allow
  children of group to implement their own behavior for responding to child
  changes.

2006-02-18 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ========== Release 0.1.2 ==========

  Removed dependencies upon Gtkmm from the Papyrus library. The Canvas class
  isn't much (for now) but will be expanded upon shortly. The former concept
  of the Canvas was moved into the newly created PapyrusGtk library as a
  CanvasArea.

  Added support for run-time introspectable properties through the Idioskopos
  library.

  Moved BoxedGroup to a simpler concept and renamed just Boxed.

  Created PapyrusGtk library separate from Papyrus library to allow separation
  between components that depend only upon cairo and those that depend upon
  Gtkmm. This actually returns to an earlier concept from the GLCanvas library
  that preceeded Papyrus and separated the OpenGL concepts from the Gtkmm
  concepts.

  The Canvas class remains in Papyrus, and CanvasArea is in PapyrusGtk which
  holds a Canvas.

2006-02-11 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Changed notation of smart pointers by moving typedef's of smart pointer
  inside class resulting in name change from ptrDrawable, ptrRectangle, ptr...
  to Drawable::pointer, Rectangle::pointer, Shape::pointer...

  Updated configure.in and papyrus.spec.in to include RPM package checks for
  FC4 when creating papyrus.spec

2006-02-07 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  example_factory: Fixed missing creation of TEXTBOX shape.


2006-02-05 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  ========== Release 0.1.1 ==========

  Added new library header papyrus.h that includes all other headers.

  Added new example, drawable_test, that uses example_factory() to create a
  comprehensive test/example application for all drawables.

  Papyrus::PNG - Renamed to Papyrus::Image

  Papyrus::Group - Fixed several redraw bugs when adding, removing or clearing

  example_factory: Initial working version

  Papyrus::Canvas
    Fixed clear() bug by adding queue_draw() after clearing root object since
    root object was requesting a queue_draw_area(0,0,0,0)

    Added set_scale() convenience method

2006-02-04 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Moving toward creation of factory methods for drawables. In preparation:
    Added static create methods for all drawables that return smart pointers.
    Changed Group methods to require smart pointer rather than reference.
    Also updated and tested examples to reflect change.

  Changed papyrus::Lines to papyrus::Polyline; in gtkglcanvas this was used to
  represent a set of distinct lines, but it has now morphed into what is better
  described by the term 'polyline'

2006-01-27 Rick L Vinyard Jr <rvinyard@cs.nmsu.edu>
  Modified to reflect change to cairomm from cairo.

  Removed the Pattern class due to changed to rely on cairomm instead of cairo.
  The Pattern class is not necessary since cairomm supplies a much more complete one.

  Change drawing operations to use cairomm instead of cairo
