This release features a new controller called Zoomer providing mouse wheel zooming of drawables.

There is a new viewport widget named ScrolledViewport. It contains a basic viewport, but adds vertical and horizontal scrollers and provides an API very similar to Gtk's ScrolledWindow widget.

Also new are two drawing modes. One allows for intermediate drawing, primarily to support compositing. The other is alpha drawing using cairo's paint_with_alpha() methods.

The drawable controller's have also had the insert() method renamed to add() to match Papyrus::Group's syntax.

Support for rounded rectangles is also added using the corner_radius property of rectangles.

There are also a number of other small enhancements and/or bug fixes.
