This release is primarily a bugfix release. There was an overload resolution 
bug with the virtual and non-virtual render() methods. Because of scoping
rules, the virtual methods were not seen by descendants of Renderable
causing an infinite recursion of the virtual method resulting in a
segfault.

To remedy this, two new macros have been created: PAPYRUS_RENDERABLE()
and PAPYRUS_DRAWABLE(). In addition to adding the using directive
to a class these macros provide some of the other repetitive code
used in each descendant of Renderable and Drawable, including
declaration of smart pointer types.

Additionally, a small bug in the shapes example program has been fixed.
